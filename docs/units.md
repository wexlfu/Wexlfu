Rationale for adding units, along with source location.

# Animated Lich
Level 4 lich without the "ancient" requirement.

# Doom Bat - Reign of the Lords, The Golden Age
High-level bat familiar.

# Dwarvish Scribe - Core
Level 1 for runemaster line.

# Eyestalk - Return from the Abyss
Traditional underground monster, present in many places already.

# Golems - Era of More Units
Alternative route for necromantic/animation magic.

# Rogue Mage Line - Liberty
Magi of Thar-Nella who have not wholly thrown themselves into the dark arts (and thus are not aspiring for lichdom).
